Weekly tasks
======
### ***HelloWorld***

    Write a program that outputs "Hello World"
    

<details>
           <summary>User point of view</summary>
           <p>

This file should contain a python program that displays Hello World! when it is run.


  ### ***Bank***


Write a program called bank.py 

The program should:

Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234567890
XXXXXX7890


  ### ***Collatz***
    
Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

Have the program end if the current value is one.

  ### ***Square root***

    Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.

I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
